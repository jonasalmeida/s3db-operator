An S3DB operator is a function with states that propagate between entities of its core model. The mechanism of propagation makes use of three individual functions - merge, migrate and propagate. This projects hosts implementations of the code in various platforms developed to implement them, including the original generic version, written in m-code (runs in Matlab, Freemat and Octave). These three functions were also coded in javascript and a browser based application was developed to illustrate how they work, with links to the .m and .js source code.
